# Chapter 10 Questions and Answers

#### 1. Try inserting two `NPC` types in one insert.

It would look like this:

```edgeql
for person in {('Jimmy the Bartender', '1893-09-10', '1893-09-11'), ('Some friend of Jonathan Harker', '1893-07-08', '1893-07-09')}
union (
  insert NPC {
    name := person.0,
    first_appearance := <cal::local_date>person.1,
    last_appearance := <cal::local_date>person.2
  }
);
```

#### 2. Here are two more `NPC`s to insert, except the last one has an empty set (she's not dead). What problem are we going to have?

The problem is that EdgeDB doesn't know what type the last `{}` is. You can see it by doing a quick `select {('Dracula\'s Castle visitor', '1893-09-10', '1893-09-11'), ('Old lady from Bistritz', '1893-05-08', {})}`:

The output is:

```
ERROR: QueryError: operator 'union' cannot be applied to operands of type 'tuple<std::str, std::str, std::str>' and 'tuple<std::str, std::str, anytype>'
  Hint: Consider using an explicit type cast or a conversion function.
```

A cast to `<str>{}` is an option, but we could do something more robust. First change the `{}` to an empty string, and then specify that `last_appearance` has to have a length of 10, and otherwise make it `<cal::local_date>{}`:

```edgeql
for person in {('Dracula\'s Castle visitor', '1893-09-10', '1893-09-11'), ('Old lady from Bistritz', '1893-05-08', '')}
union (
  insert NPC {
    name := person.0,
    first_appearance := <cal::local_date>person.1 if len(person.1) = 10 else <cal::local_date>{},
    last_appearance := <cal::local_date>person.2 if len(person.2) = 10 else <cal::local_date>{}
  }
);
```

#### 3. How would you order the `Person` types by last letter of their names?

Just order by doing a slice of the final letter:

```edgeql
select Person {
  name
} order by .name[-1];
```

#### 4. Try inserting an `NPC` with the name `''`. Now how would you do the same query in question 3?

If we try to do the same query as above, we get the following error:

```
ERROR: InvalidValueError: string index -1 is out of bounds
```

No problem though. One way is to filter out anything with a length under 1:

```edgeql
select Person {
  name
} filter len(.name) > 0 order by .name[-1];
```

Or if you don't want to filter it out, you could just add a dummy character for anything without a length of at least 1:

```edgeql
select Person {
  name := ' ' ++ .name if len(.name) = 0 else .name
} order by .name[-1];
```

#### 5. Dr. Van Helsing has a list of MinorVampires with their names and strengths. We already have some MinorVampires in the database. How would you `insert` them while making sure to `update` if the object is already there?

You can do it with `unless conflict on` and `else`. An insert for one named Carmilla then would look like this:

```edgeql
insert MinorVampire {
  name := 'Carmilla',
  strength := 10,
} unless conflict on .name
else (
  update MinorVampire
  set {
    name := 'Carmilla',
    strength := 10,
  }
);
```

Then even if his data has a conflicting name (like 'Woman 1'), it will still update with their correct strength instead of just giving up:

```edgeql
insert MinorVampire {
  name := 'Woman 1',
  strength := 7,
} unless conflict on .name
else (
  update MinorVampire
  set {
    name := 'Woman 1',
    strength := 7,
  }
);
```
